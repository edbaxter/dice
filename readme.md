# Dice

We were at the pub, having just setup monoploy, there was no dice, that's fine we'll find one on the internet easy enough, and sure we did. However each of the web dice we found kept reloading the page, scrolling back to the top of the page ect.. It was not a pleasent experience.

So here we have [justafuckingdice.com][justafuckingdice]. A simple JS based dice!
