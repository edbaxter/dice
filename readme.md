# Dice

We were at the pub, having just setup monopoly, there was no dice, that's fine we'll find one on the internet easy enough, and sure we did. However each of the web dice we found kept reloading the page, scrolling back to the top of the page ect.. It was not a pleasant experience.

So here we have [justafuckingdice.com][justafuckingdice]. A simple JS based dice!

### In case you were wondering, yes, I won the game of monopoly ;)
